### Functionality
#### Four circles

I worked on four circles with two buttons at the beginning. Each circle is a div. By assigning each colour a number, randomly generates different amount of number each time with sound and compare the order of the circle clicked buy used.

### Featured Piece of Code
This lets the chosen circle change colour by DOM elements. In order to make the circle lighting one by one, I assign setTimeout function within another function. From app.js
```

### Styling
Initially, I made four colourful circles for the game and then I switched to the outer space style, with four rotating  plants by using CSS animation. From style.css

### Future Features
There are some features I would like to add in the future:
* Adding more audios, different circles will play different sound when chosen.  
* Creating a score board to keep tracking number of user clicks.
* Set different levels, time will decrease each level.
* Two player mode, so two user can compete with each other.
