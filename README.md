Galaxy Wars is memory game based on the concept of "Simon Says". Playing the game has both fun and the awareness of protecting the living environment.

Galaxy Wars is my first project of Web Development Immersive in General Assembly. It is my first game built individually with the practice of HTML,CSS and JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

* Git
* GitHub
* HTML5 with HTML5 audio
* CSS3 with animation
* JavaScript (ECMAScript 6)
* jQuery
* Google Fonts

### Functionality
#### Four circles

I worked on four circles with two buttons at the beginning. Each circle is a div. By assigning each colour a number, randomly generates different amount of number each time with sound and compare the order of the circle clicked buy used.

### Featured Piece of Code
This lets the chosen circle change colour by DOM elements. In order to make the circle lighting one by one, I assign setTimeout function within another function. From app.js
```

### Styling
Initially, I made four colourful circles for the game and then I switched to the outer space style, with four rotating  plants by using CSS animation. From style.css

### Future Features
There are some features I would like to add in the future:
* Adding more audios, different circles will play different sound when chosen.  
* Creating a score board to keep tracking number of user clicks.
* Set different levels, time will decrease each level.
* Two player mode, so two user can compete with each other.
